Here you can find an overview of the exercises that are part of the course, including the themes that these tests illustrate or treat.

- Day 1: Rivers:

  - Ex. 1: Channel flow:
    - 1.1 Equilibirum flow
    - 1.2 Backwater curve
    - 1.3 Flood wave
  
  - Ex. 2: Weir flow:
    - 2.1 Energy loss
    - 2.2 Perfect weir flow
    - 2.3 Drowned weir flow
    
  - Ex. 3: Groyne flow:
    - 3.1 Energy loss
    - 3.2 Flow structure (eddies)
    - (3.3 Grid resolution?)

- Day 2: Lakes and reservoirs:

  - Ex. 4: Wind-generated set-up and circulations in a homogeneous lake
    - 4.1 Wind over lake with uniform depth (2DH) 
    - 4.2 Wind over lake with non-uniform depth (2DH)
    - 4.3 Wind over lake with uniform depth (3D)
    - 4.4 Wind over lake with non-uniform depth (3D)
  
  - Ex. 5: Wind-effects on a stratified lake
    - 5.1 Baroclinic tilt and vertical  circulations
    - 5.2 Internal flow
