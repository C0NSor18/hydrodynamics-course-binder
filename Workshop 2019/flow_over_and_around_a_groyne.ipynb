    "In this exercise we consider the flow over and around a groyne. In many numerical river models, groynes are represented by weirs, where the theoretical weir loss is added to the governing equations to represent the energy loss due to the structure. It would thus be interesting to investigate whether a groyne has a similar energy loss as a weir. In constrast to the previous exercises, no analytical solution is present for this case. Additionally, this case is now also a real two-dimensional (2D) case, where the flow can vary in the lateral direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the weir case. we consider two-dimensional flow with a ’subgrid’ weir. The difference is now that the weir extends only halfway across the channel, representing a groyne. Again, ’subgrid’ refers to the fact that the weir is represented as a thin wall on a cell edge. A different approach would be to represent the weir as an increased bed level in one/more cell(s), which would mean that the grid resolution would determine how well the weir is resolved. To avoid this, the weir is represented by a vertical ’wall’ on a cell face. In other words, the bottom topography is flat, i.e. all cells have a constant flat bed, only one cell edge (with two cell corners) has a raised bed level."

    "The groyne can be emerged or submerged, depending on the upstream and downstream water levels (or the flow discharge). When the groyne is submerged, the flow can be compared to that over the weir, from the previous exercise, and the flow regime can again be subcritical (for high water stages and submergence ratios) or supercritical (for lower water stages). For the supercritical flow condition, the flow on top of the groyne will again be critical and and could think that the (specific) discharge (at least close to the groyne foot) would be close to the maximum possible discharge as it was computed for the weir case: $q_{critical}$. For the groyne, this specific discharge would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$q_{critical} = \\frac{2}{3}E_{up}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}gE_{up}}$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "As one can see, this discharge would again be dependent only on the upstream energy head, as for the weir. However, the flow can also go around the groyne and the water upstream and downstream of the groyne are, therefore, connected. It can expected that the discharge over the groyne will only be independent of the downstream water level, if the flow adjacent to the groyne (in the main channel) is also supercritical, which it could become due to the flow contraction that is formed by the groyne. We will qualitatively analyze, whether the flow over and around the groyne has similarities with the weir case."

At the upstream boundary we will prescribe the a water level of $\\zeta$ = 1.0 m and at the downstream boundary a water level of $\\zeta$ = 0.7 m.

The boundary position has been chosen too close to the area of interest (the groyne) in this case. Usually, with the presence of sufficient damping through bottom friction, this will not occur. However, one should be aware that this can happen, when strong flow dynamics (e.g. vortex shedding or wave phenomena) interact with the boundary.\n",
